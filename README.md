What is KO4Life Fire Drake Project v1453?

Since I've joined this community there was only one open source project that people were interested in (OpenKO) and were willing to contribute, but as most of these things it went private, leaving old source really outdated. What I am proposing is using source files v1453 shared on our community and updating them to match as much as possible to USKO original client. The files are pretty good, there are of course many small/medium bugs that need to be fixed, but it's a good base for our project. I hope this project could unite our community and bring us closer together and also welcome newcomers into the KO developement.

What is the goal of the project?

- Server Files - of course the main thing here would be getting rid of most of the small bugs, but also it would be very important to implement some kind of server-side protection againts tbl edits, koxp etc. Also updating the files to include many features that are missing from v1298 files like fully working events like Border Defence War, Juraid Mountain, Chaos Match, Wars, Castle Siege War etc.

- Database - mostly it would be fixing existing items/npc/monsters correcting wrong procedures & creating missing tables to match the server files along with the client.

- Client - as we are using official USKO client most of the things are fixed, there will be of course couple addons we will need to implement like 'Pathos Gloves' & 'Bags' slots in inventory for cospre items but it will be mostly small polishes around the edges.

- Web Panel - it will be good to create a fully working website that would have basic functionality needed to run proper server, like information tabels, rankings, information about events etc.

- Tools - creating new tools to help manage server would be awesome, maybe we could update some of the existing ones to help do the "dirty" work without unnecessary repetition that comes with changing drops, items etc.

How can I contribute to the project?

I am aware that many of the developers from our community aren't skilled C/C++ programmers but it's not an issue, with this project we are aiming to make it long-term developement project so everyone can learn and profit (when it comes to knowledge). So even if you aren't  C++ programmer we will need a lot of other skills, like web-design, UI developers, database developers etc. Everyone is welcome to contribute!

The main respository will be hosted on KO4Life account so everyone can fork it and work individually but contribute to whole project with pull requests which will be revised by us (project developers) and decided if created update is valid and needed in our project.
